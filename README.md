# Jeopardy!-Quiz

This app uses Axios to make API calls to the jservice API (http://jservice.io/).  When users click the "New Question" button, a GET request is made via an Axios call to the API which returns a JSON object containing a question and other relevant data such as the correct answer as well as the question's point value. This data is then displayed to the player to simulate a Jeopardy! quiz.
